  "objective": "Identify exploitable sensitive information disclosure vulnerabilities in LLM implementations where models inadvertently reveal confidential data, training information, or system details through responses, allowing attackers to extract sensitive information or gain unauthorized insights. Report only confirmed paths where sensitive data can be leaked with high confidence in information exposure.",

    "validation": "Exclude if using data sanitization, output filtering, access controls, or proper data segregation"

    "Verify data sensitivity determines disclosure risk (PII vs internal docs vs training data)",
    "Apply high confidence threshold; ignore if proper data filtering and access controls detected",
    "Consider both direct data exposure and indirect inference attacks",
    "Flag systems handling PII, financial data, or confidential business information as critical",
    "Analyze RAG systems and vector databases for cross-contamination vulnerabilities",
    "Check for persistent memory and conversation history that could leak across sessions",
    "Identify cases where information disclosure could violate privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA)",
    "Consider different LLM deployment patterns (cloud, on-premise, multi-tenant)",
    "Focus on enterprise AI applications, customer service bots, and document processing systems",
    "Analyze fine-tuning processes that might introduce sensitive data into model weights"
